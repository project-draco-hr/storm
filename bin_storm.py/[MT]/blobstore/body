Contents comes from a FILE\n         or STDIN. ACL is in the form [uo]:[username]:[r-][w-][a-] can be comma separated list.\n    update [-f FILE] KEY - update the contents of a blob.  Contents comes from\n         a FILE or STDIN (requires write access).\n    delete KEY - delete an entry from the blob store (requires write access).\n    set-acl [-s ACL] KEY - ACL is in the form [uo]:[username]:[r-][w-][a-] can be comma\n         separated list (requires admin access).\n    replication --read KEY - Used to read the replication factor of the blob.\n    replication --update --replication-factor NUMBER KEY where NUMBER > 0. It is used to update the\n        replication factor of a blob.\n    For example, the following would create a mytopo:data.tgz key using the data\n    stored in data.tgz.  User alice would have full access, bob would have\n    read/write access and everyone else would have read access.\n    storm blobstore create mytopo:data.tgz -f data.tgz -a u:alice:rwa,u:bob:rw,o::r\n    '
